Worst offenders were Platinum vs Silver vs Titanium, and Gold vs Solarium. Although I'm not colorblind, I guess players who are will have an even harder time to distinguish various ores.\n\nSo I added a small letter colored like the ore itself above each ore type, to make them better recognizable.\n\n\n[h1]Compatibility:[/h1]\nThis mod might not work with other mods that modify ores or add new ores, but is explicitly tested to work well with [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729824320]Illuminated Ores[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149]Frackin' Universe[/url].\n\nIf you notice any issues with mod compatibiliy, please let me know.\n\n\n[h1]Multiplayer Information:[/h1]\nThis is a client-side mod, there is no point in installing it on a server. Players with the mod can play together with players without the mod without causing any issues.\n\n\n[h1]For Non-Steam Users:[/h1]\n[url=https://github.com/Amadox/starbound_letteredores/raw/master/dist/LetteredOres.pak]Direct Download (.pak)[/url]",
